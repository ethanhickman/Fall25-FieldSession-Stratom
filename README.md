# Fall25-FieldSession-Stratom
Working repository for fall 2025 Stratom field session project. 


#### Setup
1. First build the docker by running `make build-image`. (This step only needs to be run when first cloning the repo or after changes are made to the Dockerfile)

#### Running Container
To run a container with an interactive bash shell, run `make run-container` or `make run-container-x11`. the `run-container-x11` target only works if you have xhost installed on your machine and uses x11 forwarding to display graphical output from the container. This target is required to be able to see camera output or run graphical applications.

Subsequent shells in the same container can be run with `make attach-shell`. The standard workflow is `make run-container-x11` followed by `make attach-shell` as needed for more shells.

Files created while inside the container will be configured to have root ownership. Running `make change-ownership` should change ownership to your user/group to allow for editing.

#### ROS2 Information
By default, the .bashrc for the root user should source the ros2 humble installation so this step should not be needed so long as you are in a root shell. However, if needed, run source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash. Again, the bashrc file for the root user should run this automatically.

The ros package used by this project is the dunnage_detection package. new nodes can be added to the package at `ros2_ws/src/dunnage_detection/dunnage_detection/`. Once the node is created it needs to be added as a console script entry point in `ros2_ws/src/dunnage_detection/setup.py`. Then, the package must be build by going into the `ros2_ws` directory and running `colcon build --symlink-install`. Finally, the nodes can be run with `ros2 run dunnage_detection <node_name>`.

The realsense camera has existing ros drivers that can be run in a seperate shell to publish camera data to various topics. This can be run with `ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_align_depth_launch.py`.
